## 📚 Academic Projects

See [`academic-projects/`](./academic-projects/README.md).

Projects labeled with:
- **`-tuni`** → developed at **Tampere University (Finland)**, with PDF reports. The datasets used for these projects were sourced from official public/governmental repositories in Mexico City and New York City. For full source details, see the references section in each associated PDF report.  
- **`-unam`** → coursework project at **National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM)** (Mexico), contains Spanish commentary in both code (`#`) and markdown cells, and some dataset column names and labels are also in Spanish. However, the structure and logic of the code remain accessible regardless of language. The dataset used in this notebook was provided directly by course instructors for learning purposes only.
- **`-cityu`** (future) → will represent projects from **City University of Hong Kong**.

## 🧪 Self-Learning Projects

See [`self-learning-projects/`](./self-learning-projects/README.md).

- These projects represent **11 days of practice (August 2025)** using open datasets,covering topics like air quality, power plants, and energy consumption.
- Contains Spanish commentary mostly in markdown, with some elementsin English. However, the structure and logic of the code remain accessible regardless of language.
- Datasets used for this practice were obtained from **Kaggle** (see [self-learning-projects/](./self-learning-projects/README.md) for dataset sources).
