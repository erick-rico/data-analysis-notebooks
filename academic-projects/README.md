## üìù Notes

- **`-tuni`** projects include a detailed PDF report with methods, insights, and references. Datasets are from official/public repositories and are referenced in the corresponding reports.  
- **`-unam`** project includes Spanish commentary in both code and markdown. Dataset is not publicly available as it was provided directly by course instructors.
- **`-cityu`** projects will be added after my exchange semester at City University of Hong Kong (Fall 2025).
